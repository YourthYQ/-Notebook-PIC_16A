    "## Term-Document Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we've already seen a few examples of working with text. We've used basic string operations and `pandas` `str` operations in order to manipulate text data. Now that we have some array programming and machine learning skills under our belt, we can take our exploration of text data much further. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we'll introduce one of the most important constructs for analyzing text data: the [term-document matrix.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-term_matrix)\n",
    "\n",
    "This might sound intimidating, but the idea is very simple. Consider the following three sentences. We regard each of them as a \"document.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I like Harry Potter. \n",
    "2. You like Harry Potter. \n",
    "3. I like Totoro.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of the term-document matrix as a data frame with a column for each possible word. In each column, we count up how many times that word appears in document. For example, using the three short \"documents\" above, the term-document matrix is: \n",
    "\n",
    "| document | I | you | like | harry | potter | totoro |\n",
    "|----------|---|-----|------|------|------|--------|\n",
    "| 1        | 1 | 0   | 1    | 1    | 1    | 0      |\n",
    "| 2        | 0 | 1   | 1    | 1    | 1    | 0      |\n",
    "| 3        | 1 | 0   | 1    | 0    | 0    | 1      |\n",
    "\n",
    "This turns out to be an extremely convenient format for working with text data, and we'll see soon how to use it for both sentiment analysis (figuring out how \"positive\" a word or sentence is) and topic modeling (figuring out the main \"ideas\" in a set of documents). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're very persistent, you would be able to make a term-document matrix using a lot of `for`-loops and basic string operations. However, `scikit-learn` offers a much more convenient approach. In this lecture, we'll see an example of organizing our data and constructing the term-document matrix. In coming lectures, we'll start to use our construction for data analysis. "
