    "*Sentiment analysis* is the task of evaluating whether a given passage of text is primarily \"positive\" or \"negative.\" The meanings of these terms can change in context. For example, a \"positive\" product review would indicate that the customer likes the product, whereas a \"positive\" tweet might just indicate that the user is happy that day. \n",
